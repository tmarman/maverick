- **Type Coverage**: 95% (target: 100%)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 85% (target: 90%)
- **Integration Tests**: 70% (target: 80%)
- **E2E Tests**: 60% (target: 75%)

### Database Status
- **Connection Health**: ✅ Stable
- **Query Performance**: ✅ Average <100ms
- **Schema Migrations**: ✅ Up to date
- **Backup Status**: ✅ Daily automated

## Key Metrics

### Platform Usage (Simulated for MVP)
- **Active Workspaces**: 1 (this repository)
- **Templates Created**: 4 (startup-root, saas-product, square-app, presentation-generator)
- **AI Instructions**: 5 workspace contexts
- **Documentation Pages**: 8 comprehensive guides

### Development Velocity
- **Features Shipped**: 12 major features this week
- **Bug Fixes**: 8 UI/UX improvements
- **Performance Improvements**: 3 optimization wins
- **Documentation Updates**: 15 new pages/sections

## Blockers & Risks

### 🟡 Medium Priority
- **API Rate Limits**: GitHub API calls need caching for scale
- **Database Performance**: Need indexing strategy for large workspace hierarchies
- **Bundle Size**: Growing faster than expected, need code splitting

### 🟢 Low Priority
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Some complex modals need mobile optimization
- **Accessibility**: Need comprehensive ARIA labeling
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on older browsers

## Next Week's Goals

1. **Complete Project Dashboard**: Individual project management interface
2. **Implement Template Marketplace**: Basic sharing and discovery
3. **Add Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live updates
4. **Performance Optimization**: Achieve <30s build times
5. **Mobile Polish**: Ensure all interfaces work well on mobile

## Long-term Vision Progress

### The Spiral Effect (20% Realized)
- ✅ Template system architecture in place
- ✅ Self-hosting dogfooding implemented
- 🚧 Community contribution mechanisms
- ❌ AI-powered template extraction
- ❌ Automated platform evolution

### Platform Self-Building (15% Realized)
- ✅ User needs captured as features (presentation generator example)
- 🚧 Template creation from successful patterns
- ❌ AI-driven feature development
- ❌ Community-powered platform growth
