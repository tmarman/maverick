# TLF: Build Comprehensive User Onboarding Flow

## 📋 Description

Create a complete user onboarding experience with gamified completion tracking, GitHub/Square integration prompts, and a conversational project creation flow.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Welcome dashboard with progress gamification
- [ ] GitHub + Square connection prompts (required/recommended)
- [ ] "What do you want to build?" chat interface with org form
- [ ] Smart snippet for importing existing GitHub projects
- [ ] Gamified progress tracking with completion percentages
- [ ] Non-technical user friendly (remember: not for developers!)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

This is a Top Level Feature (TLF) that encompasses the entire new user experience from first login to having their first project set up and ready to use.

**Key Design Principle:** Make it feel like a conversation, not a form to fill out.
