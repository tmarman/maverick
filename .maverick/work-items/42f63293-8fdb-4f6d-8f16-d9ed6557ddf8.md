# Automated Square Seller App Generation Platform

## 📋 Description
Build an automated platform that generates branded mobile/web applications for Square sellers without existing apps. The system should automatically integrate with Square's inventory API, support multi-location ordering, enable order-ahead functionality, and customize branding based on seller's industry and available assets. This addresses the gap for Square sellers who lack technical resources to build their own customer-facing applications.

**Original Request:** "Many Square sellers don't have their own app. We should be able to automatically generate an app for a given seller, using their branding andimages where possible, suitable for their industry. This should all automaticaly tie into their square inventory, and allow ordering ahead and handle different locations."
