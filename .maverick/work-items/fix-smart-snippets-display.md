# Fix Smart Snippets Display in Chat - HTML Divs Not Rendering as Buttons

## 📋 Description

Smart snippets in the AI chat are not rendering as interactive buttons. Raw HTML `<div class="maverick-snippet">` elements are being hidden but not replaced with React button components.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] HTML snippet divs are properly parsed and extracted
- [ ] Snippet placeholders are replaced with interactive buttons
- [ ] Buttons have proper styling and click handlers
- [ ] Debug logs show parsing is working correctly
- [ ] Test in ContextualAIChat component (Get Advice button)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Current Status:**
- ✅ MaverickMarkdownParser updated to handle HTML divs
- ✅ ContextualAIChat component imports MaverickMarkdownRenderer
- ❌ Debug logs not appearing in console
- ❌ Buttons not rendering

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Verify ContextualAIChat is actually using MaverickMarkdownRenderer
2. Check for JavaScript errors preventing component from rendering
3. Verify snippet extraction regex is matching AI-generated HTML
4. Test placeholder replacement logic
