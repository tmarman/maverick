# AI-Powered Feature Cost Estimation System

## Feature Overview
An intelligent system that provides accurate cost estimates for software features based on complexity analysis and predicted AI assistance requirements. This enables "development bidding" where features receive precise cost estimates before implementation begins.

## Status
**✅ COMPLETED** - Fully implemented and integrated

## Business Value
- **Predictable Development Costs**: Eliminates uncertainty in AI-assisted development projects
- **Smart Budget Planning**: Enables accurate project budgeting and resource allocation  
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies high-risk features that may exceed budget expectations
- **Model Optimization**: Recommends cost-effective AI models for different development phases

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. OpenRouter Provider Integration
```typescript
// Access to 300+ AI models through unified API
export class OpenRouterProvider extends ChatAIProvider {
  // Streaming chat with cost tracking
  // Smart model routing based on task type
  // Real-time usage statistics
}
```

#### 2. Feature Complexity Analyzer
```typescript
export class FeatureCostEstimator {
  static analyzeComplexity(feature: FeatureDescription): FeatureComplexity
  static estimateCost(feature, complexity?, maxBudget?): CostEstimate
  static getMultipleEstimates(feature, modelIds[]): CostEstimate[]
}
```

#### 3. Model Metadata Registry
- **Pricing data** for 8 major models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, etc.)
- **Capability mapping** (code, analysis, reasoning, creative)
- **Performance metrics** (speed, quality, context window)
- **Smart routing functions** for optimal model selection

### Key Features

#### Complexity Analysis Engine
- **Keyword Detection**: Analyzes feature descriptions for complexity indicators
- **Category Classification**: UI, API, Database, Integration, Algorithm, Infrastructure
- **Size Estimation**: XS/S/M/L/XL/XXL with corresponding hour estimates
- **Risk Factor Calculation**: Multipliers for high-risk feature types

#### Token Usage Prediction
```typescript
const TOKEN_USAGE_PATTERNS = {
  planning: { baseTokens: 2000, perComplexityPoint: 500, rounds: 2 },
  coding: { baseTokens: 5000, perComplexityPoint: 1500, rounds: 3 },
  review: { baseTokens: 1000, perComplexityPoint: 300, rounds: 1 },
  documentation: { baseTokens: 1500, perComplexityPoint: 200, rounds: 1 }
}
```

#### Cost Breakdown by Development Phase
- **Planning Phase**: Requirements analysis, architecture design
- **Coding Phase**: Implementation with AI assistance iterations  
- **Review Phase**: Code review, debugging, optimization
- **Documentation Phase**: Technical docs, comments, guides

#### Intelligent Model Selection
```typescript
getBestModelForTask('code' | 'analysis' | 'creative' | 'fast' | 'cost-effective', maxCostPer1M?)
```
